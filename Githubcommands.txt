git pull origin master
## git pull origin master will pull changes from the origin remote,master branch 
## and merge them to the local checked-out branch.

git pull origin/master
## git pull origin/master will pull changes from the locally stored 
## branch origin/master and merge that to the local checked-out branch. 
## The origin/master branch is essentially a "cached copy" of what was 
## last pulled from origin, which is why it's called a remote branch in git parlance. 
## This might be somewhat confusing


## You can see what branches are available with 
## git branch and git branch -r to see the "remote branches".

## git pull means git fetch followed by git merge. 
## It fetches the content from the remote, then merges it into your current branch. 
## But origin/master is a local branch (tracking a remote branch).
## If you want to merge it, you don't need to fetch anything. 
## It's misleading to say git pull origin/master when you're not actually fetching from a remote.
